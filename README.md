# **UnitCLI** – Unit Test Generator for Java

**UnitCLI** is a powerful command-line tool designed for Java developers to **streamline and accelerate** the creation of unit tests. It automatically generates well-structured test cases using **JUnit** and **Mockito**, allowing you to focus on building robust applications while maintaining high code quality.

With just a few commands, UnitCLI helps you:

* Quickly generate unit tests for your classes.
* Choose between **Mockito** or plain **JUnit** based testing.
* Analyze your project to get a summary of all classes.
* Explore your project's folder structure visually via the CLI.
* Improve test coverage and code reliability.

### 🚀 **Benefits of Using UnitCLI**

* **Faster development cycles:** Automate the creation of repetitive test code.
* **Increased code quality:** Catch bugs earlier with consistent unit testing.
* **Safe refactoring:** Make changes confidently, knowing that automated tests cover your code.
* **Documentation through tests:** Unit tests act as living documentation for how your code behaves.
* **Simplified test setup:** Ready-to-use CLI for macOS and Windows makes integration easy.
